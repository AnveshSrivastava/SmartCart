- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login

### User Endpoints (Requires USER role)
- `GET /api/cart` - Get user cart
- `POST /api/cart/add` - Add item to cart
- `PUT /api/cart/update` - Update cart item quantity
- `DELETE /api/cart/remove/{productId}` - Remove item from cart
- `DELETE /api/cart/clear` - Clear cart
- `POST /api/order/place` - Place order

## Role-Based Access Control

### User Role (ROLE_USER)
- Browse products
- Add items to cart
- Place orders
- View order history
- Access user-only routes

### Admin Role (ROLE_ADMIN)
- All user permissions
- Product management (CRUD operations)
- Order management and status updates
- Stock monitoring and alerts
- Dashboard analytics
- Access admin-only routes

## Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration**: Users register at `/signup` and get `USER` role
2. **User Login**: Users login at `/login` and receive JWT token
3. **Admin Login**: Admin logs in with `admin@smartcart.com` / `admin123`
4. **JWT Validation**: Frontend validates JWT with backend on each request
5. **Role-Based Routing**: Protected routes check user role before access

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Database Setup
```bash
# Start MongoDB
mongod

# Initialize database
mongo < backend/init-mongo.js
```

### 4. Test Admin Access
- Login with: `admin@smartcart.com` / `admin123`
- Navigate to `/admin/dashboard`
- Verify access to all admin features

### 5. Test User Access
- Register new user account
- Login and verify access to user features
- Test cart and order functionality

### 6. Test API Integration
- Use Postman to test backend APIs
- Verify JWT authentication works
- Test role-based access control
